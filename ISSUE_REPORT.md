# Error Analysis and Fix

## Issue Summary

The TTB Label Verification System at https://ttb-pied.vercel.app encountered an error when attempting to process an image with Google Cloud Vision API.

## Root Cause

The error was caused by missing Google Cloud Vision API credentials configured in the Vercel deployment environment variables. The application requires three environment variables:
- `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID`
- `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PRIVATE_KEY`  
- `GOOGLE_CLOUD_CLIENT_EMAIL`

## Fix Applied

I improved the error handling in two files:

1. **src/app/api/ocr/google-cloud-vision/route.ts**:
   - Updated the credential check to include `GOOGLE_CLOUD_CLIENT_EMAIL`
   - Enhanced error message to list all required environment variables

2. **src/utils/ocrProviders.ts**:
   - Added error message extraction from API responses
   - Included detailed error messages in the ProcessingError response

## User Action Required

To fix the deployment error, add the following environment variables to your Vercel project:

1. Navigate to your Vercel project settings
2. Go to "Environment Variables"
3. Add these three variables:
   - `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID` - Your Google Cloud project ID
   - `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PRIVATE_KEY` - Your service account private key
   - `GOOGLE_CLOUD_CLIENT_EMAIL` - Your service account email

## Testing

After adding the environment variables, redeploy the application. The improved error messages will now show exactly which credentials are missing if any configuration issues remain.
